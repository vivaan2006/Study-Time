# Study-Time

Study-Time is a mobile application designed to facilitate student learning and foster academic engagement. 
The app features an array of chat rooms where students can connect in real-time to collaborate, seek assistance, or work independently. 
The platform offers students the opportunity to participate in subject-specific chat rooms that cater to their unique learning needs.
For instance, if a student requires assistance with physics, they can join the physics chat room where group meetings are held to tackle
complex problems collaboratively. Moreover, the app also provides an environment where students can work independently 
while still being in a virtual public space, mimicking a traditional study setting.
